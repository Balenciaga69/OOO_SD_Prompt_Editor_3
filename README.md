# WEB-UI AI-Art Prompt Editor v3 (React 18)

This project is the third version of the WEB-UI AI-Art Prompt Editor. The first version was abandoned and the second version was developed using Angular 14. In this latest version, React 18 was used instead.

This project is deployed on Netlify as a static website. It utilizes Mantine and Bootstrap as its primary styling frameworks and also integrates several NPM packages such as CodeMirror and Dnd-kit.

The main purpose of this web application is to provide an advanced version of AI drawing prompt editor, which is more user-friendly and convenient to use compared to the basic text editor provided by web UI.

## Features

- **Customizable tag groups**: The user can create up to 10 tag groups and modify them as needed.
- **Save and load feature**: This application allows users to quickly save and access their prompt designs.
- **Intuitive weighting adjustments**: Users can easily adjust the weightings of prompts using a more visual and simple approach, instead of manually modifying the text.
